This is my final project for the data analysis module with Python in the Data Scientist Profession course at EBAC. In this project, we will explore a challenge in the financial and credit industry. The goal is to determine whether a customer is in default or not in a credit or loan. Predicting a customer's payment behavior is of utmost importance for financial institutions, as this task is crucial in risk assessment and making informed decisions.

# Resources used in Development

to accomplish this task we used the following stack:

- Kaggle Notebook
